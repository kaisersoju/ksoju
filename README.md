- 👋 Hi, I’m @ksoju short for kaisersoju or Kaiser Soju.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in Scratch and assembly but I have learned neither languages. I've tinkered with python and c/c++ but not much.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dma (memory hacking), various arduino projects, a bit of reverse engineering, protocols, windows internals and uefi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reversing usb protocol (practicing on hid descriptors at the moment) and possibly wireless stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me ??? not on social media except discord ...
