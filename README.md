- 👋 Hi, I’m @ksoju short for kaisersoju or Kaiser Soju.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding in Scratch and assembly but I have learned neither languages. I've tinkered with python and c/c++ but not much. I am mostly self taught so I do not follow the best coding practice. Don't know web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dma (memory hacking), various arduino projects, a bit of reverse engineering, protocols, windows internals and uefi. All this hints to a wholesome computer hobby. I might get into hypervisors in the future. Not sure.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reversing usb protocol (practicing on hid descriptors at the moment) and possibly wireless stuff. Would like to build gaming peripherals starting with mouse/keyboards. Work on modding them.
- 📫 How to reach me ??? not on social media except discord ...
